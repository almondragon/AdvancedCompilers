# Working with CFGs
**Due Date:** September 12, 2025

This folder of the repository contains a Python program for constructing and analyzing control flow graphs (CFGs) for Bril programs. The code also implements additional functionality including computing path lengths, reverse post order traversal, back edge detection, as well as checking reducibility

## Features
1. get_path_lengths(cfg, entry) - computes the shortest path length (in edges) from the entry node to each node in the CFG.

Parameters           | Description
-------------------- | -----------
Working with CFGS    | A python program made to construct a control flow
